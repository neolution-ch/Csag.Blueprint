## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [#20](https://github.com/neolution-ch/Csag.Blueprint/pull/20) [`453255b`](https://github.com/neolution-ch/Csag.Blueprint/commit/453255bf2f5aa0c1cf0aebf0750a19b9dce4f5ba) Thanks [@neoscie](https://github.com/neoscie)! - Add the email address and the display name of the user to audit events

  Audit events now contain `UserEmail` and `UserDisplayName` with `UserId`. The package reads these
  values from the claims on the request when it writes the event. One helper reads the claims for the
  Entity Framework path and for the HTTP path. Therefore an application can show the name of the user
  without a query on the user table.

  A service account has no email address. Therefore its email value is null, and its display name is
  the account name from the token.

  The package writes the two new values to the `JsonData` column, at `$.UserEmail` and
  `$.UserDisplayName`. This release does not change the schema. An application does not need a
  migration.
